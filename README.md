>Hello, my name is <i>Michel.C</i> but you can just call me "Michel" or mishell1m69.<br/><br/>
>I am a French student learning to code and interessted in everything related to informatics and/or technology.<br/>
>I've recently discoverd GitHub as a way to share my work to a project with a small group, and now i'm using it more personally, to create little projects where i aim to always improve myself by learning from my errors.

>Coding is really fun, but for me, it's also really meaningful to dissociate "work" from the rest of my routine,<br/>
>that's why i have some <b>passions</b> that take a big space in my life.<br/> 
>Well you've guessed it, i like to code, but my biggest passion in life is <b>cars</b> and their history, plus everything related to <b>motorsport</b> (WRC-Rallye, F1, WEC...)<br/>
>I also listen to a lot of <b>music</b>, where i tend to appreciate more than just one style, because it depends of my actual state of mind.<br/>
>On top of that, im a big fan of <b>watches</b> and really like the <b>fascinating world of watchmaking</b>!<br/>

>That's about it!<br/>
>For now, don't hesitate to support me troughout this adventure who's only at it's beginning !<br/><br/>
